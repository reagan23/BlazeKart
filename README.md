To reduce the queue rush in big grocery Stores &amp; Malls

# Problem Staement
Whenever we go to grocery store we find there is always rush and long queue at payemt counters and due to this we get irritated as queue is always long.

# Solution Recommended
There should be some app that can scan bar code so that whenever some user scans bar code the use's ID and the product is stored in database and as soon as customer reaches to pay counter he just have to pay directly without any wait time.

# Project Brief 
This is an Android App through which a user can scan whatever product he likes at grocery store and their product will be added to a virtual ID created at that time only and through that he can directly pay without any time loss.


# Software tools used
I chose Android Studio for building this App.
